# Jee

Heya, I'm Jee. This is <i>sandbox jyb</i>, my digital playground + journal for casual learnings and trying new things in digital marketing - mostly on SEO for now, but hoping to dive further into UX, CRO, and other areas too. 

When a curious ponder or thought strikes, I'll start a little research dive in. I share those discoveries here â€” from the smaller and simpler <i>Today I Learned (TIL)</i> moments, to the more in-depth learnings, failures and (hopefully!) successes along the way.

This is essentially my personal record of understanding how to help businesses connect and expand in the online organic search landscape. Feel free to explore, or if you've got insights to share, I'm all ears.
