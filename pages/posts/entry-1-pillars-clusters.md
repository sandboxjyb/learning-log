# Learnings from a Global Content Audit

Content pillars and clusters always intrigued me, tbh, but felt daunting. Luckily, I recently dived into a large-scale audit. I want to share my learnings, roadblocks, and next steps.

## What I've Been Digging Into

I’ve been deep-diving into **SEO keyword research**, specifically for **content pillars and clusters**. It's meant to be a smarter way to plan content. But starting the research? That felt a bit overwhelming, like finding my way in a new city without a map.

## Unpacking the 'Why'

Why go through all this effort? Well, it became crystal clear pretty fast. This approach is the foundation of a robust content strategy, especially for large, dynamic sites. It helps us:

* **Spot Content Opportunities:** Clearly shows where we can optimise existing content or create new pieces.
* **Gauge Ranking Strength:** Understand where we're ranking for competitive terms and related long-tails.
* **Identify Topic Performance:** See what types of content or topics we're doing well for versus those we're not.
* **Inform Site Structure:** Crucially, content pillars and clusters directly inform site architecture and internal linking opportunities. This is vital for overall SEO health.
* **Enable Ongoing Management:** For sites with many articles constantly being updated and published, this provides a structured way to manage and grow content strategically.

It's about laying the groundwork for a truly effective content strategy, internal linking strategy, and overall content management.

## What I Figured Out

Through this journey, I picked up critical insights:

* **Strategy First:** My biggest takeaway. Define your 'why' *before* you even open a keyword tool.
* **Intent is Everything:** When mapping keywords, I realised understanding user intent (commercial vs. informational) totally shifts content approach. It’s fundamental.
* **AI Overviews Insight:** I even playfully asked ChatGPT which questions it *couldn't* fully answer. Turns out, high compliance, checklists, or templates are safer bets for actual clicks.
* **Tool Data Strategy:** I learnt to stick to Google Keyword Planner for reliable MSV. SEMrush is great for tracking, but I'll ignore its MSV figures.
* **Keyword Mapping:** My spreadsheet became my central hub, distinguishing big pillar terms from supporting long-tail phrases.

## Hurdles & How I'm Tackling Them

This audit definitely had its tricky bits.

**Unclear Briefs:**
A lot of time was lost. I didn't fully understand content pillar expectations for this project. A top-level brief was provided, but I really needed to prod more for clarity.

**Manual Categorisation Headache:**
Huge time spent manually categorising exported keyword data. We had volumes, URLs, positioning. But semantically grouping them, or making them useful, took ages. Even with ChatGPT, human review is needed, which is time-consuming.

**Unreliable Monthly Search Volumes (MSV):**
MSVs from third-party tools like SEMrush were super unreliable. Hard to gauge popularity. I knew volumes differed, but not *this* crazy amount. Genuinely shocked. I expected some correlation, but often there wasn't one.

**Localisation Puzzles:**
Struggled with localised keyword research (e.g., Australia vs NZ). The process felt the same. In hindsight, only compliance, laws, or regulations truly differ. Should've focused more time there.

**Zero-Click AI Overviews:**
Another rabbit hole. I spent too much time reviewing these, unsure if we should still rank for AIOs or focus on converting terms. A clearer brief and historical conversion data would've guided me.

### My Game Plan

For the next large-scale content audit, I'll be much more deliberate.

**Clarity from the Start:**
* **Push for a super clear, upfront brief.** I'll ask all questions about goals, content types, capacity, and presentation. I'll establish regular check-ins.

**Smarter Data Handling:**
* **Automate categorisation where possible:** Refine AI use for initial semantic grouping. Budget for crucial human review.
* **Streamulate MSV data:** Exclusively use Google Keyword Planner for MSV. Only third-party tools for positioning. I'll also research MSV calculation methods.

**Targeted Research:**
* **Localisation focus:** Concentrate keyword research on compliance, laws, and regulations for localised terms.
* **AI Overview strategy:** Seek clearer guidance early on, by analysing historical content conversion/performance.

This whole process is a journey. I'm learning heaps, determined to refine my approach for better, more impactful content strategies. A real journey, this one.
